## Business Problem:

Car dealerships need an efficient way to manage vehicle inventory, customer information, sales transactions, employee tracking, and financing/insurance processing.


## Constraints:

1. Every vehicle must have a unique VIN.
2. A customer can purchase multiple vehicles, but a vehicle can only be sold once.
3. Sales must be linked to both a customer and a salesperson.
4. . Each sale can have optional finance and insurance records.
5. . Each vehicle can have multiple service records.
6. . Only employees with a sales role can be associated with a sale.
7. . TotalPrice in a sale must match or exceed the vehicle price.
